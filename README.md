## My process

### Built with

-   SASS
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   CSS Custom properties

### What I learned

I was able to learn more about positioning multiples background images and apply some SASS resources such mixins and ifs to set some repetitive properties.

### Continued development

Through this project I realized that mobile first workflow can be very useful. Probably with better technique to wrap the desktop content the mobile version would have a better looking.

### Useful resources

-   [SASS Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/if) - This helped me to build up mixins with different properties with few lines of code.
-   [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-position.asp) - It was a very useful resource to clarify how to set two background images at the same element.
